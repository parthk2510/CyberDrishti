# 3. Use this App Password below instead of your regular Gmail password
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com

# Replace with your actual Gmail address (e.g., youremail@gmail.com)
EMAIL_HOST_USER=kulkarnisiddha1611@gmail.com
# Replace with your App Password (16-character code without spaces)
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=boccoztpnyundtpb
